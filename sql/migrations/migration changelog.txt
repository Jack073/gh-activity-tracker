Migration Format
YYYYMMDDVV.sql
YYYY - 4 digit year
MM   - 2 digit month (01 - 12)
DD   - 2 digit day (01 - 31)
VV   - Incremental version counter, 2 digits (01 - 99). Resets each day, allows up to 100 migrations per day to be
        created.

This will provide us with upto 100 potential migration IDs a day, every day until 31/12/9999.
After thinking about that for about 20 seconds, I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't just extend itself past
that date anyway, but for obvious reasons I am not concerning myself with that limitation.
Using a 64 bit epoch would perhaps be simpler and make more combinations available (though not really needed), but this
system is plenty, and generates much more human-readable IDs as an advantage - it's relatively easy to determine the
order the IDs were applied in and have an idea when they were written.
